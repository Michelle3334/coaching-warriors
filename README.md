# Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps, I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

The project was then deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

1. Log in to Heroku and add a new app.
2. Link the project from GitHub to Heroku.
3. Add the ????? to the ConfigVars in Settings.
4. Add the Python and NodeJS buildpacks.
5. Manually deploy the project (I used the manual deploy option in order to control what version was deployed to the live environment).
